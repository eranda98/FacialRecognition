# FacialRecognition

Project Description:
- The goal is to build a face identification model to recognize faces.

Data Description:
- Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest
- This dataset contains 17534 images for 100 people. All images are taken from 'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library.

Objective:
- In this problem, we use a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to recognize similar faces. Here, we are particularly interested in recognizing whether two given faces are of the same person or not.
